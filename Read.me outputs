Description
For this Assignment, I am developing a monetary system for a new Mars colony by creating a KaseiCoin token contract, a KaseiCoin crowdsale contract and a KaseiCoin deployer contract. For testing, I have deployed on a local blockchain via Ganache. KaseiCoin is a fungible token and is ERC-20 compliant. The purpose of this crowdsale is to convert earthling money to KaseiCoin.

I have developed two KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol versions. One for basic functionality and another extended version for timed crowdsales. 
Please see my video that demonstrates Basic KaseiCoin Crowdsale and KaseiCoin Timed Crowdsale.
To review the functionality of the basic KaseiCoin crowdsale, see KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDemo.mov in this repository. The demonstration completes the following steps:

Deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain by using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.

Test the functionality of the crowdsale by using test accounts to buy new tokens and then checking the balances of those accounts.

Review the total supply of minted tokens and the amount of wei that the crowdsale contract has raised.
